<h1>Secure Password Generator</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project generates a secure password of a specified length, and gives the option to include special characters in the password.
It uses the secrets module, a cryptographically secure random number generator, to generate a random password that is made up of a combination of letters, numbers and special characters.
<br />
 The user is prompted to enter the desired length of the password and whether or not to include special characters in the password. The generated password is then printed to the console. This script is useful for creating secure and unique passwords for different accounts and applications.
